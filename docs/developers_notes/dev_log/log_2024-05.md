## Optimizing solver

### Debugging Vector model 1

#### Questions

- [x] How many times do the system of equations gets solved?
    - Without caching is 1 per scalar field x 2 (centers and corners) x n_octree levels

- [ ] How many iterations we need to reach the solution?
  - Model 1 takes 5000 iterations (actually starts to diverge after 4k) 

### TODO:

- [ ] Clean solver interface

### Things to try:
- [ ] Pykeops as linear operator to use exact solver
- [ ] Falkon

#### Notes
- [ ] I need to make similar default env file for gempy itself and using the default when we call the engine or whatever
