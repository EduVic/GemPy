## Optimizing solver

### Debugging Vector model 1

#### Questions

- [x] How many times do the system of equations gets solved?
    - Without caching is 1 per scalar field x 2 (centers and corners) x n_octree levels

- [x] How many iterations we need to reach the solution?
  - Model 1 takes 5000 iterations (actually starts to diverge after 4k)
   
- [ ] Has Pykeops become slower with the latest additions to the gradient?

- [x] Is the pre-conditioner shit for all cases?
  - Model 1:
    - Numpy Jacobi: Converge in
      - 1602 iterations and reach 5000
      - time 150 sec
      - More or less good results: Mesh closed
    - Numpy No jacobi
      - 1018 iterations and reach 5000
      - time 150 sec too
      - Results similar? I would say maybe a bit worse
    - Pykeosp No jacobi
      - 92 iterations and reach 5000
      - time 324 (all on running the solver)
- [ ] Can be that pykeops is faster than invert the matrix but still slower that any other CG
  - Since the matrix is already constructed, it makes sense
    - [ ] Then which cases is worth using pykeops? The number of iterations will need to be rather small
     Will it make sense on edits reusing the previous weights? This is going to need a hell of orchestrator

### Experiments conclusions
- Using pykeops CG to solve a ill posed problem is not realistic 
  - if the model fits in memory probably the best thing to do is make the first run in torch an use the weights as initial point
  - if the model does not fit in memory we should try to construct the sparse version of it and try to run the incomplete cholesky decomposition

- I didn't find any improvement using the Jacobi pre-conditioner. Mostly the opposite

### TODO:

- [x] Clean solver interface

### Things to try:
- [x] Pykeops as linear operator to use exact solver
  - Does not look good. Probably is not even possible mathematically
- [x] Falkon

#### Notes
- [ ] I need to make similar default env file for gempy itself and using the default when we call the engine or whatever
